## Security Best Practices

When using Directory Analyzer:
- Be cautious when analyzing directories that may contain sensitive files
- Review output files before sharing them, as they may contain directory names that reveal system structure
- Use appropriate file permissions when saving output files
- Be aware that the tool needs read access to scan directories
