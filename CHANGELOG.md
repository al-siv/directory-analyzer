- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes or fundamental architecture changes
- **MINOR**: New functionality added in a backwards compatible manner  
- **PATCH**: Backwards compatible bug fixes and improvements

## Migration Notes

### Upgrading to 1.2.0
- No breaking changes - all existing CLI options remain functional
- New `--extensions` parameter available for advanced filtering
- Enhanced output includes content type breakdowns (backwards compatible)
- Performance improvements automatic (no configuration changes needed)

### Upgrading to 1.1.0
- CLI argument `--error-log` renamed to `--no-access-log` (old name still works)
- Default behavior now includes hidden directories (use `--no-hidden` to exclude)
- `--min-size` now expects megabytes instead of bytes (more user-friendly)
- Output format improved but remains backwards compatible
