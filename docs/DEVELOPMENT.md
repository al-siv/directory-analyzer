- Memory usage under 100MB for typical scans
- Support for basic Windows filesystem features

### Optimization Goals
- Parallel processing for multiple drives
- Caching for repeated scans
- Incremental updates for large directories
- Progress reporting for long operations

## Known Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Windows Path Limitations**: Long path support required
2. **Permission Handling**: Graceful handling of access denied errors
3. **Performance Scaling**: Efficient scanning of large filesystems
4. **Memory Management**: Handling results for millions of directories

### Solutions Implemented
- Using pathlib for modern path handling
- Comprehensive error handling strategy
- Generator-based processing for memory efficiency
- Parallel processing for I/O-bound operations

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality Targets
- 90%+ test coverage
- Type hints for all public interfaces
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clean code principles adherence

### Performance Benchmarks
- Scan speed: >1000 directories per second
- Memory efficiency: <1MB per 10,000 directories
- Error recovery: <1% failed scans due to errors
- User experience: Responsive CLI with progress feedback

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Performance Issues**: Large filesystem scans may be too slow
   - Mitigation: Parallel processing, optimized algorithms
2. **Permission Errors**: Many directories may be inaccessible
   - Mitigation: Graceful error handling, continue on errors
3. **Memory Constraints**: Large result sets may exceed available memory
   - Mitigation: Generator-based processing, result streaming

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Windows-specific implementation
   - Mitigation: Standard library usage, platform detection
2. **User Experience**: Complex CLI may be difficult to use
   - Mitigation: Sensible defaults, clear help messages

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 hours)
1. Implement core data structures
2. Create basic directory scanner
3. Build simple CLI interface
4. Add basic error handling

### Short-term Goals (Today)
1. Complete MVP implementation
2. Add comprehensive testing
3. Optimize performance
4. Create usage documentation

### Long-term Vision (Future)
1. GUI interface development
2. Integration with system tools
3. Advanced analytics features
4. Cloud storage support

## Lessons Learned
