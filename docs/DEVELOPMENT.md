- User experience: Responsive CLI with progress feedback

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Performance Issues**: Large filesystem scans may be too slow
   - Mitigation: Parallel processing, optimized algorithms
2. **Permission Errors**: Many directories may be inaccessible
   - Mitigation: Graceful error handling, continue on errors
3. **Memory Constraints**: Large result sets may exceed available memory
   - Mitigation: Generator-based processing, result streaming

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Windows-specific implementation
   - Mitigation: Standard library usage, platform detection
2. **User Experience**: Complex CLI may be difficult to use
   - Mitigation: Sensible defaults, clear help messages

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 hours)
1. Implement core data structures
2. Create basic directory scanner
3. Build simple CLI interface
4. Add basic error handling

### Short-term Goals (Today)
1. Complete MVP implementation
