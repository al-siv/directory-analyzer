- [x] **Inverted hidden directory logic**: Default to include hidden directories (--no-hidden to exclude)
- [x] **User-friendly size units**: Changed --min-size from bytes to megabytes
- [x] **Error logging system**: Silent collection of access errors to log file

#### Cross-Platform Enhancement
- [x] **Platform-specific hidden detection**: Windows attributes vs Unix dot-files
- [x] **Unified hidden directory API**: Single function handles platform differences
- [x] **Default behavior optimization**: Include hidden directories by default for better content discovery

#### Output and Error Handling
- [x] **Clean terminal output**: Errors logged to file instead of cluttering terminal
- [x] **Improved text format**: Size first, removed position numbers for better readability
- [x] **Error summary reporting**: Count of inaccessible directories with log file reference
- [x] **Configurable error logging**: Custom access log file path option (--no-access-log)

#### Technical Implementation
- [x] **Updated ScanOptions model**: Added error_log_file parameter, changed defaults
- [x] **Enhanced scanner logic**: Error collection and logging integration
- [x] **Cross-platform utilities**: is_hidden_directory_cross_platform function
- [x] **Reporter improvements**: Size-first text output format
- [x] **Documentation updates**: README.md, architecture.md examples and explanations

#### User Experience Focus
- [x] **Simplified decision making**: Fewer options, better defaults

- Parallel processing complexity was unnecessary - always optimal for I/O operations
- Windows user content frequently stored in hidden system directories
- Byte units meaningless to average users - megabytes more practical
- Error messages cluttering terminal prevented focus on actual results
- Position numbers in output added noise without value

### Quality Improvements
- **Code simplification**: Removed unnecessary complexity from CLI interface
- **Cross-platform robustness**: Platform-specific hidden directory detection

- [x] **Inverted hidden directory logic**: Default to include hidden directories (--no-hidden to exclude)
- [x] **User-friendly size units**: Changed --min-size from bytes to megabytes
- [x] **Error logging system**: Silent collection of access errors to log file

#### Cross-Platform Enhancement
- [x] **Platform-specific hidden detection**: Windows attributes vs Unix dot-files
- [x] **Unified hidden directory API**: Single function handles platform differences
- [x] **Default behavior optimization**: Include hidden directories by default for better content discovery

#### Output and Error Handling
- [x] **Clean terminal output**: Errors logged to file instead of cluttering terminal
- [x] **Improved text format**: Size first, removed position numbers for better readability
- [x] **Error summary reporting**: Count of inaccessible directories with log file reference
- [x] **Configurable error logging**: Custom access log file path option (--no-access-log)

#### Technical Implementation
- [x] **Updated ScanOptions model**: Added error_log_file parameter, changed defaults
- [x] **Enhanced scanner logic**: Error collection and logging integration
- [x] **Cross-platform utilities**: is_hidden_directory_cross_platform function
- [x] **Reporter improvements**: Size-first text output format
- [x] **Documentation updates**: README.md, architecture.md examples and explanations

#### User Experience Focus
- [x] **Simplified decision making**: Fewer options, better defaults

- Windows user content frequently stored in hidden system directories
- Byte units meaningless to average users - megabytes more practical
- Error messages cluttering terminal prevented focus on actual results
- Position numbers in output added noise without value

### Quality Improvements
- **Code simplification**: Removed unnecessary complexity from CLI interface
- **Cross-platform robustness**: Platform-specific hidden directory detection
