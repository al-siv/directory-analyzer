## Executive Summary

Directory Analyzer is a command-line utility designed to help power users tackle unexpected storage issues by intelligently analyzing and classifying large content that has accumulated over time. The tool focuses on identifying forgotten galleries, videos, archives, and document collections that consume significant disk space, providing actionable recommendations for cleanup, archival, or cloud migration.

## Product Overview

### Vision Statement
To empower individual users with large modern storage devices to efficiently identify and manage forgotten content that unexpectedly fills their drives, transforming storage chaos into organized, actionable cleanup decisions.

### Mission
Deliver an intelligent storage analysis tool that goes beyond simple directory sizes to classify content types, analyze usage patterns, and provide specific recommendations for what to move to cloud storage, archive to permanent storage, or safely delete.

### Current Product Status
- **Version**: 1.0.0 (Basic directory analysis foundation)
- **Platform**: Tested on Windows, cross-platform design
- **Language**: Python 3.13
- **Architecture**: Command-line interface with modular design for extension
- **Scope**: Currently provides directory size analysis; evolving toward intelligent content classification

## Core Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Modern users with large storage devices (1TB+ drives) frequently encounter unexpected "disk full" situations despite having recently purchased seemingly adequate storage. The problem isn't typical system clutter or temporary files, but rather:

- **Forgotten Photo Galleries**: Years of accumulated photos and videos from various devices
- **Archive Accumulation**: Old ZIP, RAR, and compressed files with forgotten contents  
- **Document Collections**: Large sets of office documents, PDFs, and reference materials
- **Media Libraries**: Mixed collections of videos, audio files, and multimedia content

### Target User Pain Points
1. **Discovery Challenge**: Finding what's consuming space without manually browsing thousands of folders
2. **Classification Confusion**: Unable to quickly identify content types for decision-making
3. **Action Paralysis**: Knowing something is large but not knowing whether it's safe to move or delete
4. **Time Investment**: Hours spent manually exploring directory structures

### Solution Approach
Provide intelligent content analysis that categorizes files by type and usage patterns, enabling users to make informed decisions about cloud migration, archival, or deletion without extensive manual review.

## Target Users
